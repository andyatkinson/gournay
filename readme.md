Gournay is a URL shrinker. The name is a horrible pun. I started with "shrink", [referring to psychiatrists](http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/home/stoi/Why-is-a-psychiatrist-called-a-shrink/articleshow/929514.cms), then found [Kevin Gournay](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kevin_Gournay), involved in mental health, and who happens to have "Go" as part of his last name. See, I told you it was bad. :)
